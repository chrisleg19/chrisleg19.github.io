In .html document, scripts are used for react, react-dom, and babel.

For the script react-dom:

This renders the react components to the client browser (pc)

    note: for mobile, you will need react-native.



FLOW of components and rendering: 

1. Everything renders to the App component.  

2. The App component is rendered to the root div in the html.


State and Props
-Like most applications, a React component may have state (data/information).
-State can only be changed by the component that "owns" that state.
-When a component's state is changed, that entire component is re-rendered, including all of its child components.
- A "stateful" component passes any state needed by child components as props.
- Props are accessible as key/value pairs on a props object. This props object is passed to the component every time it is rendered.
- Props in a component are always read-only.



Most of the time, state is kept in the parent (top) component.
