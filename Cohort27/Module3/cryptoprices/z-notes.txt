Creating a React Router (implementing routing in the front end)

1. npx create-react-app "name of app directory"
2. npm install react-router-dom
3. npm start
4. import {BrowserRouter as Router} from "react-router-dom"  in the index.js
5. in the index.js wrap the app in the <Router></Router> tags
        <Router>
        <App />
        </Router>
6. create your pages.js (export)
7. in you App.js, import the pages
8. also import {Route, Routes} from "react-router-dom"
9. in App.js, wrap your Route in the Routes tags.  Also give it 2 properties: path & element
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Main/>}/>
            <Route path="/currencies" element={<Currencies/>}/>
            <Route path="/price" element={<Price/>}/>
        </Routes>

10. create your component (Nav)
11. import import {Link} from "react-router-dom" in your Nav component
12.  use the <Link><Link/> tags with "to" properties. This will navigate between each page or path
         <div>
            <Link to="/">
                <div>CRYPTO PRICES</div>
            </Link>

            <Link to="/currencies">
                <div>CURRENCIES</div>
            </Link>
        </div>   

13. creating params
        insert ":symbol" in <Route></Route> in App.js  ex:
        <Route path="/price/:symbol" element={<Price/>}/>


14. next steps:

The Price Component
Before we create this component take a moment to get your FREE Api key from coinapi.io. Keep in mind you can only make 100 requests per day with your free apiKey.

Once you have your api key here is what we will do:

-store the apikey and currency symbol in different variables

-use the useEffect hook to make an api call

-interpolate the apikey and symbol in the fetch URL
    NOTE:  import {useParams} from "react-router-dom" in Price.js
        - Returns an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic params from the current URL that were matched by the route path.

-save the resulting data in state and render it
    NOTE: import { useState } from "react";
    
-loaded and loading function for rendering the data if exists
