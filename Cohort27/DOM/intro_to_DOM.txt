Use developer tools in browser.
Access the console.
Access different parts of the webpage from the root document. 
type in the console of the webpage

Example:
document.body.head.title. => gives you the title of the page

within the developer tool's console, we can use the variable $0 to access/change elements in the brower (preview only)

Ex: dir($0)

note: we selected the element in the developer tool first before modifying style.
